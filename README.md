# DuoTune

DuoTune is a full-stack web app designed to connect producers and musicians seeking collaboration. The app is currently in its MVP phase and employs a Tinder-like interface for users to swipe right or left on profile cards. Built using React, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, DuoTune supports profile updates, user authentication and authorization, and filters users based on preferences. The frontend utilizes Framer Motion, Three.js, and custom illustrations for interactive animations and graphic design.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Profile cards featuring pictures, descriptions, user types, and audio snippets
- Tinder-like swiping interface for easy profile browsing
- Mutual swipes lead to chatroom pairing for further communication
- Messaging managed on the Flask backend
- Profile updates and user preferences
- Interactive animations and graphic design using Framer Motion, Three.js, and custom illustrations

## How it Works

1. Users sign up for an account or log in to an existing account.
2. Users create or update their profiles, including pictures, descriptions, user types, and audio snippets.
3. Users browse profile cards of other users and swipe right or left based on their interest in collaboration.
4. When two users mutually swipe right, they are paired in a chatroom for further communication.
5. Users can send and receive messages within the chatroom, managed on the Flask backend.
6. Users can update their profiles and preferences, filtering the displayed profile cards accordingly.
